We host ethical hacking workshops to raise awareness of the importance of IT security. The workshops are based on tasks from hacking competitions (CTFs), and show how to exploit vulnerabilities. We regularly participate in CTFs, and meet up to solve tasks together a few times each semester. You are more than welcome to join us while solving hacking tasks! Join our discord channel to get more information about joining us in hacking competitions: https://discord.gg/7aTwpGa",
